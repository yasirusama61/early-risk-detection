## üìù **Feature and Target Definition**

In battery cell manufacturing, features (inputs) represent operational parameters collected during stages like formation, aging, and testing. The target (output) indicates the quality risk level of each cell.

### üîπ **1. Key Features for Risk Prediction**

Each feature relates to battery failure modes, with deviations from standards increasing the risk level:

- **Coating Weight (Area Density)**: Inconsistent coating increases resistance (high risk).
- **Electrode Thickness**: Variability affects ion transport and performance (high risk).
- **Electrode Alignment**: Misalignment may cause short circuits (high risk).
- **Welding Bead Size**: Irregular welding can weaken connections (high risk).
- **Lug Dimensions**: Inconsistent dimensions impact current flow (high risk).
- **Moisture After Baking**: Excess moisture leads to contamination (high risk).
- **Electrolyte Weight**: Deviations affect ion transport (high risk).
- **Pressure & Temperature**: Extreme conditions increase defect risk.
- **Formation Energy & Aging Time**: Deviations indicate degradation (high risk).
- **Cycle Count**: Higher count correlates with cell degradation.

#### üîπ **Feature Selection in Code**

```python
features = [
    'positive_electrode_viscosity', 'negative_electrode_viscosity', 'electrode_coating_weight', 
    'electrode_thickness', 'electrode_alignment', 'welding_bead_size', 'lug_dimensions', 
    'moisture_content_after_baking', 'electrolyte_weight', 'formation_energy', 'aging_time', 
    'pressure', 'ambient_temperature'
]
```
## üìà **Results**

The early risk detection system has delivered the following outcomes:

- **Proactive Quality Control**: Early detection of potential risks in battery cell manufacturing allows for timely interventions, enhancing product quality.
- **MES Integration**: Real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making enabled through seamless MES integration.

  - **Accuracy**: 0.92
  - **Precision**: 0.88
  - **Recall**: 0.85
  - **F1 Score**: 0.86

### üìä **Confusion Matrix Definitions**

In binary classification, the confusion matrix compares actual vs. predicted classifications:

- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted high-risk cells.
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly predicted low-risk cells.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted high-risk cells (false alarms).
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted low-risk cells (missed risks).

### üü¶ **Confusion Matrix Structure**

|                       | Predicted Low Risk (0) | Predicted High Risk (1) |
|----------------------- |-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Actual Low Risk (0)** | TN                    | FP                        |
| **Actual High Risk (1)**| FN                    | TP                        |

### üìê **Key Metrics Formulas**

1. **Accuracy**  
   Measures overall model performance.  
   `Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`

2. **Precision**  
   Proportion of correctly predicted positives (high risk) out of all predicted positives.  
   `Precision = TP / (TP + FP)`

3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**  
   Proportion of correctly predicted positives (high risk) out of all actual positives.  
   `Recall = TP / (TP + FN)`

4. **F1 Score**  
   Harmonic mean of precision and recall.  
   `F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

5. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**  
   Proportion of incorrectly predicted positives out of all actual negatives.  
   `FPR = FP / (FP + TN)`

6. **True Negative Rate (Specificity)**  
   Proportion of correctly predicted negatives out of all actual negatives.  
   `Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)`

### üìù **Example Calculation**

For a confusion matrix with:
- **TP = 25**
- **TN = 25**
- **FP = 19**
- **FN = 31**

Applying the above formulas will yield key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and others.
