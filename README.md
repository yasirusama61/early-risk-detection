# Early Risk Detection System for Battery Cell Manufacturing

## Overview

This project establishes a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for an early risk detection system in **battery cell manufacturing**. It proactively identifies potential quality issues in real-time through machine learning and integrates with the **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)** for real-time monitoring.

## Features

- **MVP Development**: Initial risk detection system focusing on core functionalities.
- **Concept Verification**: Validates feasibility and algorithm performance.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement using the PDCA cycle.
- **MES Integration**: Integrated with MES using custom APIs and OPC-UA protocols.
- **Validation Testing**: Rigorous testing across various conditions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming**: Python, R
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Database**: SQL, MongoDB
- **MES Integration**: Custom APIs, OPC-UA protocols

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed data for model training and testing.
- `scripts/`:
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Preprocess data and handle missing values.
  - `model_training.py`: Train machine learning models for risk detection.
  - `mes_integration.py`: Communicate with MES using custom API.
  - `validation_testing.py`: Evaluate the model on new test data.
- `results/`: Metrics, plots, and evaluation results from model testing.
- `models/`: Trained models stored for further use.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/early-risk-detection.git
    cd early-risk-detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run data preprocessing:
    ```bash
    python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

4. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python scripts/model_training.py
    ```

5. Validate the model:
    ```bash
    python scripts/validation_testing.py
    ```

## Results

- **Proactive Quality Control**: Detects potential risks early in the process.
- **MES Integration**: Seamless real-time monitoring and decision-making.
- **Validation Metrics**: Model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
